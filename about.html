          <h1 class="header1">Where we started</h1>
        
          <p>In the middle of the town, the first shop of White Swan, a vintage jewelry brand, now looks all quiet and closed. This old place, with its tired front and shut windows, feels a bit sad and full of memories. <br>
            <br> The pretty designs on the outside, not so bright anymore, tell stories from a long time ago. Even though the door is locked, you can almost hear the sounds of people who used to come in. <br>
            <br> Behind the dusty glass, the inside, once filled with shiny jewels, seems stuck in the past. White Swan' first shop, now not open, holds on to old stories and moments that slipped away.</p>
